1. What class should implement the Comparable interface? 
The Media class should implement the Comparable<Media> interface. Since Book, DigitalVideoDisc, and CompactDisc all inherit from Media, implementing it in the parent class ensures that all types of media in the cart can be compared against each other .

2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want? 
In the Media class, the compareTo(Media other) method should be implemented with the following logic to reflect the default ordering (usually by title, then cost):
+Compare the title of this media with the other media (using String's compareTo).
+If the titles are different, return that result.
+If the titles are the same, compare the cost of the two media (using Float.compare or Double.compare for precision).

3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 
No. 
The Comparable interface is designed to define the "natural ordering" of a class, meaning an object can only have one implementation of the compareTo() method. To support multiple different sorting rules simultaneously (switching between title-first and cost-first), you must use the Comparator interface .

4. Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this? 
To allow this, you would override the compareTo() method specifically inside the DigitalVideoDisc class. The logic would be:
+Check if the object being compared against is also a DigitalVideoDisc.
+If it is, compare by title first.
+If titles are equal, compare by length in descending order.
+If lengths are equal, compare by cost.
+If the other object is not a DVD, rely on the general sorting rule defined in the parent Media class.
